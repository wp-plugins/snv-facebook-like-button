== Description ==

This plugin allows you to drop in a very simple widget that showcases the new Facebook "like" button powered by OpenGraph.  When a user inserts this into their site, and a reader clicks the like button, their picture will show up in the space provided.  Also, an entry onto the users "Recent Activity" will show that they liked your site\'s entry.  Very easy to use, and very easy to implement.  Options allow setting of the width and color scheme (light or dark).  
  
This plugin is loosely based on ajb{log}'s "Facebook Like Button Widget" plugin.

If you set the option to Manual, use **`<?php if(function_exists('add_facebook_button')) { add_facebook_button(); }?>`** If you uninstall the plugin, this will ensure your theme still works.

== Changelog ==
0.1a - initial release.  
0.2a - fixed spacing issue both above and below
1.0 - first stable release - added manual insertion of plugin via function.
1.5 - added the rest of the options FB gives you (minus the button type - I like the faces, and that's specifically what I designed this plugin to do).
1.6 - for some reason 1.5 couldn't be downloaded so 1.6 is just a clone to resync the plugin repository.
