== Description ==

This plugin allows you to drop in a very simple widget that showcases the new Facebook "like" button powered by OpenGraph.  When a user inserts this into their site, and a reader clicks the like button, their picture will show up in the space provided.  Also, an entry onto the users "Recent Activity" will show that they liked your site\'s entry.  Very easy to use, and very easy to implement.  Options allow setting of the width and color scheme (light or dark).  
  
This plugin is loosely based on ajb{log}'s "Facebook Like Button Widget" plugin.
